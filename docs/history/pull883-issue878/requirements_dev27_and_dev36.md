# Requirements
PyCharm auto-detect wanted to install more packages 

**devXX_setup**: These are requirements installed when `tox` ran `setup.py 
install` and `setup.py test` scripts.

**devXX_setup_pc**: These are requirements that extend the `tox` 
install and test runs, based on what the PyCharm IDE indicated as missing.

The requirements can be found in the root directory
